# Data Structures In Java

This was the presentation material for my uni AP class, and I tried to include good practices for implementing each
structure. I've also included two problems that can be solved using common data structures which you can find in the *
problems*
package.

> Included Structures:
> * Array List
> * Linked List
> * Stack
> * Queue
> * Hash Map
> * Graph
>> The class *Driver* contains usages of each structure.
